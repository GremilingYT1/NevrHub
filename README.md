# NevrHub

NevrHub is a open to use, free (optional ad route to support my work) for anyone to use on Mac, Windows, iOS and Android :D
Feel free to contact me on discord - _myst3ry.

There will be a 2nd version called NevrHub 2.0 that will be exclusively paid BUT will have so many more features, more support and frequent updates. This **does not** mean NevrHub will not be updated either.
